# Desktop-3D-Printed-Robotic-Arm
-> easy to use, affordable 3d printed robotic arm, 4 DOF and can be controlled using Arduino and ESP8266
Designed and fabricated a lightweight, low-cost planar manipulator using 3D-printed components and a four-bar linkage mechanism, including a custom motor-control PCB built with an Arduino Nano, A4988 stepper drivers, and NEMA-17 actuators.
Performed numerical optimisation of link dimensions to maximise the robot’s reachable workspace, validating the final geometry through kinematic analysis and prototype testing.

Here is the final designed 3d model and its respective 3d printed desktop version
